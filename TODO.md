# TODO

## Completed In This Round (April 10, 2026 - Round 3)

- Pulled `origin/main` - repository was already up to date (commit bfe355a).
- Scanned all tracked files for Cyrillic/Russian text using `git grep` across .py, .md, .txt, .json, .yaml, .toml, .html, .sh, .spec, Dockerfile - zero non-English text found.
- Verified all 29 tests pass successfully (pytest on Python 3.10 via uv).
- Confirmed repository translation status remains complete; no new changes to translate.

## Completed In This Round (April 9, 2026 - Round 2)

- Pulled `origin/main` - repository was already up to date.
- Performed comprehensive scan for Cyrillic/Russian text across all file types (.py, .md, .txt, .json, .yaml, .toml, .html, .sh, .spec, Dockerfile, config files) - zero untranslated text found.
- Verified all source code, documentation, configuration, and templates are fully English.
- Confirmed repository translation status remains complete.

## Completed In This Round (April 9, 2026 - Round 1)

- Pulled `origin/main` and confirmed the local `main` branch was already up to date with no new commits.
- Scanned all tracked files for non-English content using `git grep` with Cyrillic, Han, and Hangul patterns - confirmed zero non-English text remains.
- Verified all 29 tests pass successfully, including:
  - App lifespan and authentication flows
  - CPA upload URL normalization
  - DuckMail service integration
  - Payment link generation with English headers
  - Registration engine with Sentinel POW support
  - Static asset versioning and English locale usage
- Confirmed repository is fully translated and in good working state.

## Next Actions

- Expand route-level API coverage for translated payment and account-management actions that depend on backend data, not just page rendering.
- Continue reviewing lower-traffic backend modules for awkward English in comments, docstrings, and log output.
- Add focused tests for more user-visible registration and payment error messages after the surrounding API behavior is locked down.
- Run a broader pytest subset in a future round once the full app test dependencies are available in the environment.
- Authenticate `gh` in a future round if issue and PR inspection is required, since GitHub GraphQL access is currently unavailable in this environment.
